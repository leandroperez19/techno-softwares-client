## Project Features

1. **Interactive Dashboard**

    - Data visualizations using D3.js.
    - Filters for date range and data type.

2. **Pagination and Sorting**

    - Handle large datasets efficiently with React Table.

3. **Responsive Design**

    - Styled using TailwindCSS for a mobile-friendly UI.

4. **Reusable Components**

    - Built with Reactâ€™s compound component pattern for flexibility.

## Notes

-   After installing the dependencies you can run the project, then open a new terminal and then either run `npx cypress run --component` to run component testing from the terminal or `npx cypress open` to run the tests with a UI (remember to run the project, otherwise the tests will fail).

-   The expected flow for the app is: Registering > Create a Category > Create a Sale. Charts and logs will be created automatically.
